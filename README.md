The Bank Account console application allows users to create a bank account, deposit and withdraw funds, view account information, and delete an account.
The application creates a separate text file to store information about created accounts, ensuring that previously entered data is not lost after the application is closed and re-opened.
Additionally, an additional version of the business account is created that refunds 10% of the withdrawn value.
